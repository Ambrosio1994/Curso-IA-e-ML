In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset in the lab, then use this Network to train your model. We will use the Convolutional Network as a feature generator, only training the output layer.  In general, 100-200 images will give you a good starting point, and it only takes about half an hour.  Usually, the more images you add, the better your results, but it takes longer and the rate of improvement will decrease.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IYw58DHV-nXx"},"source":["-

samples utilized in one iteration. If the batch size is equal to the total number of samples in the training set, then every epoch has one iteration. In Stochastic Gradient Descent, the batch size is set to one. A batch size of 32--512 data points seems like a good value, for more information check out the following <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-cvstudio-2021-01-01\">link</a>.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UYr5jB0K-nYB","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1715818262857,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"DIEGO AMBROSIO","userId":"04645390355005059837"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["batch_size=32"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jpUhFHxa-nYC"},"source":[" <b>Learning rate</b> is used in the training of neural networks.
